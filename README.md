# g-assistant-mac
A client for the *Google Assistant SDK* in the MacOS Menubar.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting anything, you'll need a bunch of python packages, you can install them using **pip**:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you'll need to get your access to Assistant's api in the **[Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)**. You can follow [this](https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-get-google-assistant-on-your-windows-mac-or-linux-machine/) tutorial for a step-by-step tutorial for setting up the python client (and auth) in your device.

### Installing

**Whoops!** I haven't made a proper macOS app yet, but you can test the app using:

````shell
python app.py
````
